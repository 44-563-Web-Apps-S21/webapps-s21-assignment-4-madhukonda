<h2>SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.</h2>
<h3><p class="stage-direction">Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants</p></h3>

<h6 class="name AEGEON">AEGEON<br></h6>
<p  class="speech ">
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall <br>
And by the doom of death end woes and all. <br> 
</p>
<h6 class="name SOLINUS">SOLINUS<br></h6>
<p class="speech "> Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more; <br>
I am not partial to infringe our laws: <br>
The enmity and discord which of late <br>
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke <br>
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, <br>
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives <br>
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods, <br>
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks. <br>
For, since the mortal and intestine jars <br>
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, <br>
It hath in solemn synods been decreed <br>
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, <br>
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more, <br>
If any born at Ephesus be seen <br>
At any Syracusian marts and fairs; <br>
Again: if any Syracusian born <br>
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, <br>
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose, <br>
Unless a thousand marks be levied, <br>
To quit the penalty and to ransom him. <br>
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, <br>
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; <br>
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die. <br>
</p>
<h6 class="name AEGEON">AEGEON <br></h6>
<p class="speech ">Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, <br>
My woes end likewise with the evening sun. <br>
</p>
<h6 class="name DUKE SOLINUS">DUKE SOLINUS <br></h6>
<p class="speech ">Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause <br>
Why thou departed'st from thy native home <br>
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus. <br>
</p>
<h6 class="name AEGEON">AEGEON <br></h6>
<p class="speech">A heavier task could not have been imposed <br>
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable: <br>
Yet, that the world may witness that my end <br>
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence, <br>
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave. <br>
In Syracusa was I born, and wed <br>
Unto a woman, happy but for me, <br>
And by me, had not our hap been bad. <br> 
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased <br>
By prosperous voyages I often made <br>
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death <br>
And the great care of goods at random left <br>
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:<br>
From whom my absence was not six months old<br>
Before herself, almost at fainting under<br>
Before herself, almost at fainting under<br>
The pleasing punishment that women bear,<br>
Had made provision for her following me<br>
And soon and safe arrived where I was.<br>
There had she not been long, but she became<br>
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;<br>
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,<br>
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.<br>
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,<br>
A meaner woman was delivered<br>
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:<br>
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--<br>
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.<br>
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,<br>
Made daily motions for our home return:<br>
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,<br>
We came aboard.<br>
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,<br>
Before the always wind-obeying deep<br>
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:<br>
But longer did we not retain much hope;<br>
For what obscured light the heavens did grant<br>
Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br>
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;<br>
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,<br>
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br>
Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br>
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br>
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br>
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.<br>
And this it was, for other means was none:<br>
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<br>
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:<br>
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br>
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,<br>
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;<br>
To him one of the other twins was bound,<br>
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:<br>
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,<br>
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,<br>
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;<br>
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br>
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br>
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br>
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;<br>
And by the benefit of his wished light,<br>
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered<br>
Two ships from far making amain to us,<br>
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:<br>
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!<br>
Gather the sequel by that went before.<br>
</p>
<h6 class="name DUKE SOLINUS">DUKE SOLINUS<br></h6>
<p class="speech ">Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;<br>
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.<br>
</p>
<h6 class="name AEGEON">AEGEON<br></h6>
<p class="speech">O, had the gods done so, I had not now<br>
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!<br>
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br>
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;<br>
Which being violently borne upon,<br>
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br>
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<br>
Fortune had left to both of us alike<br>
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br>
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened<br>
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,<br>
Was carried with more speed before the wind;<br>
And in our sight they three were taken up<br>
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br>
At length, another ship had seized on us;<br>
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<br>
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;<br>
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,<br>
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<br>
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br>
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;<br>
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,<br>
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.<br>
</p>
<h6 class="name DUKE SOLINUS">DUKE SOLINUS<br></h6>
<p class="speech ">And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,<br>
Do me the favour to dilate at full<br>
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.<br>
</p>
<h6 class="name AEGEON">AEGEON<br></h6>
<p class="speech ">My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br>
At eighteen years became inquisitive<br>
After his brother: and importuned me<br>
That his attendant--so his case was like,<br>
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--<br>
Might bear him company in the quest of him:<br>
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,<br>
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.<br>
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,<br>
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<br>
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;<br>
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought<br>
Or that or any place that harbours men.<br>
But here must end the story of my life;<br>
And happy were I in my timely death,<br>
Could all my travels warrant me they live.<br>
