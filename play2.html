        <p class="speech">Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd<br>
        To bear the extremity of dire mishap!<br>
        Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,<br>
        Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,<br>
        Which princes, would they, may not disannul,<br>
        My soul would sue as advocate for thee.<br>
        But, though thou art adjudged to the death<br>
        And passed sentence may not be recall'd<br>
        But to our honour's great disparagement,<br>
        Yet I will favour thee in what I can.<br>
        Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day<br>
        To seek thy life by beneficial help:<br>
        Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;<br>
        Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,<br>
        And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.<br>
        Gaoler, take him to thy custody.<br>
